Quartex Pascal (short: QTX) is an object pascal IDE, compiler, run-time library and development system. Unlike traditional, native development systems, such as C/C++, Delphi or Freepascal, QTX generates high performance JavaScript â€“ allowing developers to tap into web technology and enjoy the full might of modern mobile, desktop and server development.
